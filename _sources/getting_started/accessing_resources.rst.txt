Accessing Resources
===================

As an intern, you'll have access to several key resources to support your learning and project work. This document provides instructions on where to find essential resources, including our Intern Program Documentation site, Google Drive, and GitHub repositories. Please follow the guidelines here to ensure smooth access to all materials.

1. **Intern Program Documentation Site**
   -------------------------------------
   The Intern Program Documentation site is your primary resource hub. It contains all essential onboarding materials, guides, tutorials, and policies relevant to your role.

   - **Location:** [https://intern.pmconline-nonprod.global]
   - **Contents:** 
     - **Onboarding Checklists**: Step-by-step instructions for getting started.
     - **Learning Resources**: Access structured resources for learning our tech stack, including Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Flutter, and Python.
     - **Team Directories**: Contact information and team roles.
     - **Process Documents**: Documentation on workflows, task management, and internal processes.

   **Tip**: Bookmark the documentation site and refer to it regularly. It is continually updated with new materials, so it’s an excellent place to check for recent guides or policy changes.

2. **Google Drive**
   ----------------
   Google Drive is where we store shared files, presentations, and other collaborative documents. Important documents such as project specifications, meeting notes, and internal presentations are organized here for easy access.

   - **How to Access**: You should receive a Google Drive invitation to your email account. If you have not received an invitation, please reach out to your onboarding coordinator.
   - **Folder Structure**:
     - **Intern Program**: Contains training materials, onboarding guides, and shared documents for all interns.
     - **Team-Specific Folders**: Each team has a dedicated folder (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.), where you can find resources specific to your area of focus.
     - **Policies and Procedures**: Find official policies, including the code of conduct, performance expectations, and attendance policies.

   **Best Practices**:
   - Avoid editing shared documents directly unless instructed.
   - Download files for offline use if you’re working in areas with limited internet access.
   - Check document version history to track updates or restore older versions if needed.

3. **GitHub Repositories**
   -----------------------
   Our GitHub repositories contain the source code for all our projects. Familiarizing yourself with our repositories will be essential to your work here. Interns are typically granted read access to relevant repositories and write access as needed for your specific tasks.

   - **GitHub Organization**: [Insert GitHub Organization URL]
   - **Repository Structure**:
     - **Core Repositories**:
       - `intern-program-docs`: Contains documentation and templates for the intern program, including code samples and best practices.
       - `pmc-web-user-portal`: The web portal codebase, where frontend interns can explore our Angular setup.
       - `pmc-backend-services`: Contains backend services developed using Spring Boot and Java.
       - `pamc-mobile`: The mobile application codebase written in Flutter.
       - `pmc-ai-aku`: Our Python-based AI module repository, where Python interns can explore and contribute to machine learning solutions.
     - **Forking and Cloning**:
       - You can fork repositories to make personal changes or clone repositories for local development. 
       - Follow the `README.md` in each repo for detailed setup instructions.
     - **Creating and Merging Branches**:
       - **Branch Naming**: Use the format `feature/your-feature-name` for new features and `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes.
       - **Pull Requests**: Always create a pull request when you have completed work on a branch. Tag your mentor or team lead for a code review.

   **Version Control with Git**:
   If you’re unfamiliar with Git, refer to the `version_control.rst` file for a full guide. It’s essential to learn how to create branches, commit changes, push code, and resolve merge conflicts. 

4. **Troubleshooting Access Issues**
   ---------------------------------
   - **Google Drive**: If you encounter issues accessing Google Drive, check that you are signed in with your email. Contact mentor if access is still restricted.
   - **GitHub**: Ensure you have accepted the invitation to join our GitHub organization. If you’re having trouble cloning or forking a repository, verify your SSH key configuration or contact your mentor for guidance.

5. **Additional Help and Support**

   If you have questions or run into issues, there are multiple ways to get help:
   - **Documentation Site**: Review the FAQ or troubleshooting sections.
   - **Mentors**: Reach out to your assigned mentor for specific questions.
   - **Team Communication Channels**: Use WhatsApp for quick questions, or post in the relevant channel on our Intern Program Documentation site’s forum.
