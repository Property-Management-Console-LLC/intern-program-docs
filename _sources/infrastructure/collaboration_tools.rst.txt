Collaboration Tools
===================

We use several tools to facilitate communication and collaboration within the team. Each tool serves a specific purpose in our workflow.

1. **GitHub**  
   GitHub is our platform for version control and managing our codebase. You will use GitHub to:
   
   - Clone repositories
   - Create branches for features or bug fixes
   - Commit and push changes
   - Create pull requests for code reviews
   - Discuss and track issues
   
   **Getting Started with GitHub:**
   - Sign up at https://github.com/ and create an account.
   - Get familiar with common Git commands: `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.
   - Learn how to fork, branch, and submit pull requests.

2. **Notion**  
   Notion is our centralized platform for documentation and project management. You will find:
   
   - Project timelines and milestones
   - Tasks assigned to each team member
   - Meeting notes and documentation

   **Getting Started with Notion:**
   - You will receive an invitation link to access our workspace.
   - Familiarize yourself with how to create pages, add content, and comment on existing tasks.

3. **WhatsApp**  
   We use WhatsApp for quick communication, primarily for day-to-day discussions and urgent queries.
   
   - Join the companyâ€™s WhatsApp group once you receive an invitation.
   - Use the group for real-time updates or queries.
   - Keep all critical project discussions on GitHub or Notion to ensure transparency.

4. **Zoom**  
   Zoom is our tool for virtual meetings and collaboration sessions. Whether for daily standups, sprint reviews, or team syncs, Zoom is essential for maintaining communication across remote teams.
