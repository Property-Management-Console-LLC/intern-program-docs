Escalation Process
==================

When facing an issue that you cannot resolve with common troubleshooting steps, follow this escalation process to seek further assistance. Proper escalation helps to resolve issues quickly and efficiently.

**Step 1: Self-Troubleshooting**
   - Review the `Common Issues <common_issues.rst>`_ document.
   - Refer to internal documentation and tutorials on the `Intern Program Documentation Site <index.rst>`_.

**Step 2: Consult Your Team Lead**
   - If the issue persists, reach out to your immediate team lead or mentor.
   - Provide a detailed description of the issue, including any steps you've already taken to troubleshoot.

**Step 3: Managerial Escalation**
   - For critical issues impacting project timelines or affecting multiple team members, the support team may escalate the issue to CEO, CFO, CTO, COO.
   - Managers will work directly with the support team to prioritize and resolve the issue quickly.

Following this process ensures that issues are documented and tracked, allowing our team to resolve them effectively. For questions about escalation, speak with your team lead.
