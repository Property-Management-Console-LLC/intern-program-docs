Agile Methodology
=================

At our company, we follow Agile methodologies to ensure flexible, efficient, and collaborative software development. This approach allows us to respond quickly to changes and deliver value to our clients consistently.

Key Agile Practices
-------------------

1. Scrum Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We primarily use Scrum, with the following key components:

- Sprint Planning: Held at the beginning of each 2-week sprint to plan the work.
- Daily Stand-ups: Quick 15-minute meetings to sync up and address any blockers.
- Sprint Review: Demonstration of completed work at the end of each sprint.
- Sprint Retrospective: Team reflection on the past sprint and identification of improvements.

2. User Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We break down features into user stories, following the format:
"As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

3. Kanban Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use a Kanban board in Jira to visualize our workflow and manage tasks.

4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We employ CI/CD practices to automate testing and deployment processes.
