Deployment Procedures
=====================

Our deployment procedures ensure that new features and bug fixes are released efficiently and safely to our production environment.

Deployment Pipeline
-------------------

1. Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Developers work on feature branches.
- Changes are pushed to GitHub and a PR is created.

2. Continuous Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Jenkins runs automated tests on every PR.
- SonarQube performs code quality and security checks.

3. Staging Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Approved changes are merged to the 'develop' branch.
- Automated deployment to the staging environment occurs.
- QA team performs manual testing in staging.

4. Production Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- 'Develop' is merged to 'main' for release.
- Jenkins builds and tags a release version.
- Automated deployment to production using blue-green deployment strategy.

5. Post-Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Monitor application performance and error rates.
- Be prepared for quick rollback if issues are detected.

Deployment Schedule
-------------------
- Regular deployments occur every two weeks, at the end of each sprint.
- Critical hotfixes can be deployed as needed, following an expedited version of the standard process.

Rollback Procedure
------------------
In case of critical issues:
1. Product owner decides to rollback.
2. DevOps team reverts to the previous stable version in production.
3. Notify all stakeholders about the rollback.
4. Investigate the issue and apply fixes before attempting redeployment.
