Testing Practices
=================

Comprehensive testing is essential to ensure the reliability and quality of our software. We employ various testing methodologies throughout our development process.

Types of Tests
--------------

1. Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Write unit tests for individual functions and methods.
- Aim for high code coverage (target: 80% or higher).
- Use JUnit for Java and Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript.

2. Integration Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Test interactions between different components or services.
- Focus on API endpoints and database operations.
- Use Spring Boot Test for backend and Cypress for frontend.

3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Simulate real user scenarios across the entire application.
- Use Selenium or Cypress for automated browser testing.

4. Performance Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Conduct load testing to ensure the application can handle expected traffic.
- Use tools like JMeter or Gatling for performance testing.

5. Security Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Regularly perform security scans using tools like SonarQube.
- Conduct penetration testing at least twice a year.

Test-Driven Development (TDD)
-----------------------------
We encourage Test-Driven Development:
1. Write a failing test.
2. Write the minimum code to pass the test.
3. Refactor the code while keeping the test passing.
