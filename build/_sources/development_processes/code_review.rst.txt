Code Review Process
===================

Code reviews are a crucial part of our development process. They help maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch potential issues early.

Code Review Guidelines
----------------------

1. Create a Pull Request (PR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Create a PR in GitHub when your feature branch is ready for review.
- Provide a clear description of the changes and link relevant tickets.

2. Reviewer Assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Assign at least two reviewers to each PR.
- One reviewer should be from your immediate team, and one from another relevant team.

3. Review Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reviewers should check for:

- Code correctness and logic
- Adherence to coding standards and best practices
- Proper test coverage
- Documentation updates
- Performance considerations

4. Addressing Feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Respond to all comments, either by making changes or explaining your approach.
- Use "Request changes" for major issues and "Approve" when satisfied.

5. Merging
^^^^^^^^^^
- PRs require at least two approvals before merging.
- The author is responsible for merging after receiving approvals.
