Tech Stack
==========

Our tech stack consists of several technologies that span different areas of our software. Below is a breakdown of each component and its role in our overall architecture.

1. **Java with Spring Boot**  
   Spring Boot is used for building our backend services. It provides a robust framework for creating APIs, handling business logic, and interacting with databases.

   - **Why Spring Boot?**  
     Spring Boot simplifies the development of production-ready applications by offering:
     - Dependency management with Maven or Gradle.
     - Built-in tools for creating REST APIs.
     - Easy integration with databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

2. **Angular**  
   Angular is our framework for building dynamic and responsive web applications. It provides a structured way to build user interfaces, manage data, and handle client-side routing.

   - **Why Angular?**  
     Angular offers:
     - A powerful templating engine for dynamic content.
     - Two-way data binding for smooth interaction between the UI and data.
     - A modular structure for maintainable code.

3. **Flutter**  
   Flutter is used for developing our mobile applications. It allows us to write code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android platforms.

   - **Why Flutter?**  
     Flutterâ€™s main advantages include:
     - Fast development with hot reload.
     - A rich set of pre-built widgets for designing beautiful user interfaces.
     - Native performance for both Android and iOS.

4. **Python (AI Piece)**  
   Python is the language we use for building AI features in our application. It is widely used in the data science and AI community because of its rich ecosystem of libraries.

   - **Why Python?**  
     Python offers:
     - Excellent libraries for machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
     - Simple and clean syntax, making it easy to develop and maintain AI models.
     - Integration with data processing libraries like pandas and NumPy.
